•	The factors analyzed were:
o	Grade level (9th, 10th,11th,12th)
o	School size in terms of number of students
o	Money spent per student

Results:
•	Due to suspected academic dishonesty the 9th grade math and reading scores were replace with NaN in order not to skew the results

•	The Charter schools had highest reading, math and overall passing scores. These two schools had the lowest number of students as well as the lowest dollars spent per student


•	Bailey High School

•	Ford High School
•	Hernando High School
•	Huang High School
•	Johnson High School

•	All seven District schools had higher budgets as well as money spent per student, yet all had lower reading, math and overall percent passing scores than Charter schools.

Summary:
•	The schools with higher budgets scored lower
•	The larger schools had lower scores
•	The schools with higher budgets scored lower in all categories, reading, math and overall
•	The larger schools had consistently lower scores in all categories, reading, math and overall.
